# WOW-MOP-Classic---MSBT
Updated MOP Classic MSBT

Retail version used was generating many LUA errors when trying to edit MSBT options

Used AI to debug and resolve the issues, seemed to be an issue with MSBTOptionsPopups.lua classString not being defined properly
Which seems to be related to the "Class Colors" option in the general tab

Options like changing fonts / configure scroll area seem to work now (basic testing done on my behalf)

# Disclaimer: I will not be monitoring / updating this going forward, this was just to get the MSBT options working
